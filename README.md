# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

**Medical Insurance Cost Prediction** is a machine learning mini-project designed to predict medical insurance costs based on various input features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. This project utilizes Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for estimating medical insurance costs using supervised machine learning techniques. The project involves:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Building and training machine learning models.
- Evaluating the model's performance.
- Visualizing the results for better insights.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the dataset to identify patterns and trends.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict medical insurance costs.
- **Visualization**: Use plots to present insights and results.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Leverage Jupyter Notebooks for an interactive coding experience.

## Tech Stack

The project is developed using:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and model building.
- **Python**: For implementing machine learning models and data manipulation.
- **HTML**: For any supplementary visualization or reports.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raibhavesh/Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
   ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
6. Open the main notebook file and follow the instructions inside to run the analysis and predictions.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset into the notebook (if not already included in the repository).
2. Follow the steps in the notebook for data cleaning, visualization, and model training.
3. Adjust model parameters or preprocessing steps as needed.
4. Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance.
